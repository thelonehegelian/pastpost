PastPost is a groundbreaking application that redefines how we preserve and experience memories. Imagine being able to create audio recordings, capture pictures, write heartfelt notes, and compose letters to your future self, friends, or family members.

The experience is designed to evoke a sense of wonder and excitement, reminiscent of opening a time capsule.
